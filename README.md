# CPS 278 - Java Spring Framework

This is a selection of the homework problems for the Washtenaw Community College class [CPS 161 - Java Spring Framework](https://catalog.wccnet.edu/current/courses/cps-278.php) which I took in Summer 2023.

"In this course, students will learn about Java Spring Framework. Topics include: Inversion of Control (IoC), Spring MVC (model-view-controller), Hibernate CRUD operations (create, read, update and delete), and Spring REST (representational state transfer). Students will learn how to develop a real time project with Spring MVC, Hibernate and Spring REST."
